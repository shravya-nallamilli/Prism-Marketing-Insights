## üìä Key Insights

### Slide 1: Executive Summary

### Slide 2-3: RFM Segmentation
- **Insight**: Low-frequency customers (F4) contribute disproportionately high revenue, driven by purchases of luxury items like Gucci or Prada.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Retain these customers through loyalty programs and exclusive promotions.
  - Shift M4 (low spenders) to M3 by promoting moderately priced premium products and value bundles.

### Slide 4: Geographic Trends
- **Insight**: Cities like London, Manchester, and Birmingham are top revenue drivers, while smaller cities show growth potential.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Prioritise campaigns in urban centers focusing on high-demand items like sneakers and T-shirts.
  - Launch localised seasonal promotions in smaller cities to expand the customer base.

### Slide 5: Demographic Insights
- **Insight**: An even gender split (40%-49%) is unusual for fast-fashion retail, presenting opportunities for targeted engagement.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Female customers: Campaigns highlighting top three purchases (T-shirts, lifestyle shoes, sweatshirts). Expected click-through rate boost: +10-15%.
  - Male customers: Monthly emails alternating between their top five items (e.g., joggers, polo shirts). Expected click-through rate boost: +15-20%.
