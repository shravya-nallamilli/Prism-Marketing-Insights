## üìä Key Insights

### Slide 3: Executive Summary
- **Overview**: 
  - Prism is a fast-fashion e-commerce retailer offering trendy and affordable clothing.
  - The project focuses on analysing data from 2020-2021 to uncover insights that support targeted marketing efforts and improve customer engagement.

---

### Slide 4-5: RFM Segmentation
- **Insight**: 
  - Customers in the **low-frequency segment (F4)** generate high revenue, often purchasing luxury items like Gucci or Prada.
  - Frequent buyers (F1/F2), while consistent, tend to have smaller basket sizes and lower overall revenue contributions.
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Retain F4 customers with loyalty programmes and exclusive offers.
  - Convert M4 (low spenders) to M3 by promoting moderately priced premium products through targeted email campaigns featuring value bundles.
  - Increase average basket size for F1/F2 by using cross-selling and upselling strategies.

---

### Slide 6: Geographic Trends
- **Insight**: 
  - Revenue is concentrated in key cities like **London**, **Manchester**, and **Birmingham**, while smaller cities present growth opportunities.
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Focus campaigns in urban centres on high-demand products such as sneakers and T-shirts.
  - Launch seasonal promotions in smaller cities, featuring bundled offers like sweatshirts and shoes to attract new customers.
  - Use geographic insights to personalise marketing efforts based on regional preferences.

---

### Slide 7: Demographic Insights
- **Insight**: 
  - Prism's customer base is evenly split between genders (40%-49%), which is atypical for fast-fashion businesses.
  - Female customers frequently purchase T-shirts, lifestyle shoes, and sweatshirts, while male customers buy a broader range, including joggers, polo shirts, and running shoes.
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Design three annual email campaigns for female customers, focusing on their top three purchases, leading to a **10-15% boost in click-through rates** and an additional **¬£500k in revenue**.
  - Target male customers with monthly emails featuring their top five items, yielding a **15-20% increase in engagement** and an additional **¬£1m in revenue**.

---

### Slide 8: Behavioural Analysis
- **Insight**: 
  - Medium spenders have shown a **189% year-on-year growth**, making them the most promising segment.
  - Their average basket value is ¬£75, with an expected 45% growth in 2022.
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Engage medium spenders with monthly ‚ÄúWe Miss You‚Äù campaigns and promotional offers (e.g., 10% discounts).
  - Anticipated additional turnover: **¬£250k** from this segment.
